### Objective
Your assignment is to implement an analytics dashboard using React, Next.js and/or Typescript to illustrate on-chain metrics and portfolio analytics for given wallet addresses on Ethereum. The dashboard should be a seamless user journey highlighting metrics and network growth through sleek visualizations.

## Brief
Similar to tools such as Dune Analytics, GrowThePie, and Etherscan - please provide a high-level overview of network analytics as well as wallet information to help a new user understand the health of the network as well as make informed decisions. Feel free to use open-source RPC endpoints such as Ankr/Alchemy as well as isolate the data you are processing to a small block range. The tasks below outline what we are looking for!

## Tasks
* The Application should provide users with a homepage that highlights some network stats for example you could show:
  * Most Recent Block
  * Top Smart Contracts
  * Top Wallets
  * Number of Transaction Growth over Time
  * Recent Transactions
* Then for an address specific page, you could show:
  * ERC20 Balances
  * NFTs
  * Recent Transactions
  * Transaction history
* Feel free to explore different avenues in your approach to this problem. We are not looking for all specific points above to be completed but more of a smooth user journey that demos your vision. 

## Deliverables
Make sure to include all source code in the repository. To make reviewing easier, include a compiled version of your assignment in a folder named public.

## Evaluation Criteria
* React/Next/Typescript best practices
* We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program.
* Show us your work through your commit history
* Completeness: did you complete the features?
* Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
* Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
* Testing: is the system adequately tested? are you using Cypress or Playwright?

## CodeSubmit
Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,

The Provable Team
